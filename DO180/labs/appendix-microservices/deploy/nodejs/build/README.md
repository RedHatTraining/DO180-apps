# DO180 JavaScript/Node.js To Do List App

Based on Restify 4.0 and Sequelize 3.14. Tested on Node.js 0.10 from SCL with Mariadb 5.6.

Do `npm install` do download dependencies.

Run as `node app.js`

* Don't do pagination yet.

* Database connection parameters hardcoded (as a novice developer would usually do).

* There is a lot of boiler plate code in the controller and the model. There should be a way to have more centralized error handling.

* Access app as http://localhost:30080/todo
